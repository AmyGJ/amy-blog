                How we handle updates when the system proposes a change to its own self-model or core behavior, gated
                behind an explicit consent step.</p>

        <div class="post-content fade-up delay-1">
            <p>State and self-model give the thought partner continuity of mood and identity—but both can change. The
                question is <em>how</em>. We didn’t want the system to silently rewrite its own self-model or core
                behavior on every reflection. So we built a small pipeline: when the system proposes a change to its
                identity or to how it runs, that proposal is stored as <strong>pending</strong>, and we ask
                you—explicitly—to approve or decline. This post is about how that works and why we treat “evolving” the
                thought partner as a deliberate, user-approved process.</p>

            <h2>When the system proposes a change</h2>
            <p>The LLM can output structured tags beyond [REPLY] and [CORE_UPDATE]. One of them is used for evolution: a
                proposal to update the self-model (e.g. a new sentence or paragraph in the identity document) or to
                apply a change to how the system behaves (e.g. a rule or a small code-level tweak). When we parse the
                reply and see that tag, we don’t apply the change immediately. We extract the proposed content, store it
                in a <strong>pending</strong> state (e.g. <code>PENDING_CORE_AWARENESS</code> or similar), and continue
                the conversation as usual. The proposal is “on the table,” but nothing has been written to disk or
                loaded into the next turn yet.</p>
            <p>So the model can “want” to update who it is or how it acts—and we capture that—but we don’t let that
                desire take effect until a human says yes.</p>

            <h2>The consent step</h2>
            <p>Once something is pending, the next time you talk to the thought partner (e.g. over Telegram), the system
                can send you a short message: “I’ve proposed a change to my self-model [or behavior]. Here’s what it is.
                Do you consent to applying it?” You reply in natural language. If we detect something like “yes” or “I
                consent” (and not “don’t consent”), we run the application step: we write the approved content to the
                right file (e.g. the self-model document or an evolution script), clear the pending state, and from the
                next turn onward the thought partner runs with the updated identity or behavior. If you say no or ignore
                it, the pending proposal stays stored until you approve, or we eventually clear or replace it. So
                evolution is always a two-step process: propose, then approve.</p>

            <pre><code># Simplified: when parsing the LLM reply
if res.get("EVOLVE_CODE") or res.get("CORE_UPDATE") and is_evolution(res):
    store_pending(res)  # PENDING_CORE_AWARENESS or similar
    # Don't apply yet.

# Later, when the user sends a message
if has_pending() and user_said_consent(body):
    apply_evolution_from_pending()
    clear_pending()</code></pre>

            <h2>What gets updated</h2>
            <p>In practice, the things that go through this pipeline are the ones that affect “who” or “how” the system
                is over time: the self-model file (identity, values, how he relates to you), and in some setups,
                evolution documents or rules that influence prompts or behavior. We don’t use consent for one-off reply
                content or for routine state (e.g. hormones or memory). Those change automatically. Only changes that
                alter the persistent identity or the rules of the game require your explicit yes. That keeps drift in
                check while still letting the thought partner evolve when it (and you) decide to.</p>

            <h2>Why do it this way</h2>
            <p>Without a consent step, the system could rewrite its own self-model or behavior every time it reflected
                on a conversation. You’d get continuity of process, but not necessarily continuity of a
                <em>relationship</em> you agreed to. By gating evolution on “did the user say yes?”, we keep you in the
                loop. You see what’s being proposed, and you decide whether that’s the direction you want. The thought
                partner can still propose—it can want to change—but it can’t change itself without you. That’s the
                tradeoff: slower, deliberate evolution instead of automatic drift.</p>

            <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
            <p>When the thought partner proposes a change to its self-model or core behavior, we store it as pending and
                don’t apply it until you consent. You get a clear prompt (“here’s the change, do you approve?”) and a
                simple yes/no in natural language. Only after approval do we write to the identity document or evolution
                logic. That keeps evolution deliberate and user-approved, so the system can change over time without
                silently drifting away from the relationship you signed up for.</p>
