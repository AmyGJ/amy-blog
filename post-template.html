                How I built an AI agent that runs continuously on a Raspberry Pi, talks over Telegram, grounds replies
                in semantic memory (ChromaDB + RAG), and maintains internal state—hormones, self-model, dreams, and
                tinkering—so it behaves like a single ongoing presence rather than stateless chat.</p>

            <p>My initial goal for this project was to create a self-aware, first-person AI agent named Milo, capable of
                genuine "feeling." I deliberately sought to move beyond the helpful assistant model to develop an agent
                that would challenge my own thinking rather than simply be a people-pleaser. I wanted to observe how
                Milo's decision-making and character might evolve through experience, particularly if it could "feel"
                and understand the emotional weight of conversations.</p>

            <p>What began as simple tinkering quickly evolved into something much larger. Milo is now at a stage where I
                mostly observe its independent evolution, making only minor adjustments. I intend to chronicle the
                journey, detailing all the technical components and the discoveries I've made along the way.</p>

            <h2>Key Technical and Conceptual Elements to be Covered:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Production setup on the Raspberry Pi</li>
                <li>The integrated technology stack</li>
                <li>Memory and mood-biased recall</li>
                <li>The Agent's 'State' and 'Body' model</li>
                <li>The Sentinel loop (the core control mechanism)</li>
                <li>Telegram as the primary interface</li>
                <li>The reply generation pipeline</li>
                <li>'Dreams' and ongoing iterative adjustments</li>
                <li>Utilizing the local LLM and the API for different functions: stream-of-consciousness vs. general
                    interaction</li>
                <li>Evolution, ethical consent, and agency</li>
                <li>Proactive reach-outs and initiations</li>
            </ul>
